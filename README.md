# Project Mine
## Features
1744 .csv files, containing 1+ sessions (rows) with following info...
1. ICCID: a general ID parameter
2. CONNECT_TIME: when a session is started
3. CLOSE_TIME: when a session is finished
4. DURATION: shows how much cellular data (in bytes) is consumed during the session
5. COUNTRY_NAME: country where the session is consumed
## Scope
1. Find better/more optimal approach/tool within AWS environment, or outside it
2. Better organize & visualize data in aggregate (monthly) and by ICCID
3. New meaningful patterns/insights over time
## Deliverables
### Visualizations
#### csv_combiner.py
This script is for your personal use to combine several csv files exported by AWS to one file. To use, port all desired csv files to one folder, and reference the correct directory in line _ of the script.
#### simple_bar_graph.py
![](https://github.com/marygooneratne/celitech/blob/master/visualizations/simple.png)
This python script parses the data from July-August 2019 to generate the graph above, a visualization of data usage (in MB) by user.
#### racing_bar_graph.py
This python script parses the data from July-August 2019 to generate the graph above, a visualization of data usage (in MB) by country. The visualization is animated, showing the increase in usage for each country over time. The number on the right shows the day, beginning in June. The file is available as visualizations/racing_bar_graph.gif.
#### global_heat_map.py
![](https://github.com/marygooneratne/celitech/blob/master/visualizations/heatmap.png)
This python script parses the data from July-August 2019 to generate the graph above, a global heatmap illustrating countriesâ€™ respective usages. This visualization is interactive when run locally.
#### duration_scatter.py
![](https://github.com/marygooneratne/celitech/blob/master/visualizations/scatter.png)
This python script parses the data from July-August 2019 to generate the graph above, a visualization comparing the length of a connection to how much data it used.
